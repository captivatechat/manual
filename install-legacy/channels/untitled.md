# Alexa

1. You will be needing an Amazon Alexa account for this one, so proceed to create one or login if you have it already.
2. You will then be redirected to your skills page, select the skill you want the bot to connect to, or create a new one.
3. Fill in the intents, slots as needed by your business requirements. The most important thing to configure is the endpoint, which is under the endpoints section. Provide this webhook: `https://channel.prod.captivat.io/api/alexa/integration`. On the dropdown, select the second option. Then build your skill.
4. Take note of the `Skill ID`.
5. The next step is to configure your echo bot if not configured. We will not cover these steps. However, there are some guides on the internet that can help you with the configuration.
