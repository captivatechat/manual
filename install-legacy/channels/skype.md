1. To enable skype, we would need an azure portal account. So Proceed to create one.
2. On your azure portal dashboard, navigate to the app services section, and add a Bot Channel Registration service.
3. Supply the details needed, and leave the default values behind. And donâ€™t forget the messaging endpoint url: `https://channel.prod.captivat.io/api/skype/integration`
4. On your service, go to the channel section, and proceed to add a skype connection.
5. On the details page, feel free to edit the details as you see fit. The most important thing to remember is our `App ID`, and the `App Password`. To view the password, you will notice that behind the App ID label, there will be a Manage word, click that one.
6. Under the client secrets, add a new one, take note of the generated client secret as this is available only to be seen once.
