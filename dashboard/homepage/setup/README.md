**Setup** is where the magic happens!

Clicking the drop-down arrow will reveal the following components:

### AI Assistants

Create and edit all your AI Chatbots in  ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>).

### Chat Flows

Create and edit your Chat Flows in  ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>).&#x20;

***

Clicking either **AI Chatbot** or **Chat Flows** for the first time will reveal an empty tab. However, they will slowly get populated by AI Chatbots and Chat Flows as you use our platform.&#x20;
