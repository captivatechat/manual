The **Transcripts** tab reveals captured notable dialogue between Users, Agents, and AI Assistants.&#x20;

When people use the Chat Flows you create with Captivate Chat, useful dialogue is captured and stored within your account. You can review these in the **Transcripts** tab.

The **Transcripts** listed in the Transcripts Tab are arranged based on the following components:

* **Hub Name:** This is the name of the Chat Flow where the intelligent dialogue occurred.
* **Name:** This is the User who interacted with the Channel.
* **Channel:** This is the Channel used in the interaction - either an automated Chatbot or an agent via Live Chat.
* **Date and Time**
* **Options**
  * **Export PDF**
  * **Report Issues:** Escalate an issue you encountered with the Transcript to the Captivate team.

Clicking a Transcript will reveal a **Transcript View**. This reveals the relevant dialogue captured by our system. It has the following components:

* **Name:** The name of the Channel involved. In this case, it's a Chatbot named "GoldenFred."
* **Last Activity:** The last activity of the Channel.
* **Channel:** The Channel implementation type, in this case a Web Widget.&#x20;
* **Chat Log:** A replication of the conversation involving the relevant Chatbot and the user.
