# Create a Chat Flow

Use a **Chat Flow** to unite AI Assistants, Live Chats, and Channels into one seamless interface. Once you set up a Chat Flow, you can easily modify all of its components - no need to use many apps!&#x20;

To create a Chat Flow, follow these steps:&#x20;

## Setting Up

A pop-up window should appear. Under **Create your Chat Flow**, fill up the following:

* **Chat Flow Name:** Give your Chat Flow a name. It's recommended that you name it based on the specific process you want to fulfill.&#x20;

Click _**Create Chat Flow**_ when you're finished.

Once you name your Chat Flow, you will be taken to **Step 1: AI Assistant.**&#x20;

Select the AI Assistant you want to be involved in this particular Chat Flow. Think of it as choosing the Chatbot that will interact with your audiences through your platform (your website or social media platform, to name a few). &#x20;

You are offered two choices:

* Select an existing Chatbot from your list.
  * Click the Chatbot you want to use. Make sure it is fully functional.
  * If you want to check its details, click _**Next: AI Assistant Platform**_. It will take you to the exact steps of the previous section, <**Create an AI Assistant>.**
  * Once you are content with your choice, click **Step 2: Channel.**
* Create a new Chatbot via _**+AI Assistant.**_
  * Choosing this takes you to the exact steps of the previous section, <**Create an AI Assistant>.**

After selecting the active Chatbot in your Chat Flow, it's time to choose your **Channel**. This is where your users will encounter your AI Assistant.&#x20;

We are offering different Channel Integrations into your Chat Flow, with different instructions how to set up each. Check each of them under the **\<Channel: \[Name]>** sub-pages, or through these links:

After deciding on your Chatbot and Channel, you can now choose your **Live Chat Vendor**. This determines what internal messaging platform your Chatbots will link back to if your users want to talk to available agents.
