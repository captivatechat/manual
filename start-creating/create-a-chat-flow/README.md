Once you name your Chat Flow, you will be taken to **Step 1: AI Assistant.**&#x20;

Select the AI Chatbot you want to be involved in this particular Chat Flow. Think of it as choosing the Chatbot that will interact with your audiences through your platform (your website or social media platform, to name a few). &#x20;

You are offered two choices:

* Select an existing Chatbot from your list.
  * Click the Chatbot you want to use. Make sure it is fully functional.
  * If you want to check its details, click _**Next: AI Assistant Platform**_. It will take you to the exact steps of the previous section, <**Create an AI Assistant>.**
  * Once you are content with your choice, click **Step 2: Channel.**
* Create a new Chatbot via _**+AI Assistant.**_
  * Choosing this takes you to the exact steps of the previous section, <**Create an AI Assistant>.**
