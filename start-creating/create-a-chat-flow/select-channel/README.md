After selecting the active Chatbot in your Chat Flow, it's time to choose your **Channel**. This is where your users will encounter your AI Chatbot.&#x20;

We are offering different Channel Integrations into your Chat Flow, with different instructions how to set up each. They are accessible via [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") or in these pages:

{% content-ref url="channel-web-widget/" %}
[channel-web-widget](channel-web-widget/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="channel-facebook.md" %}
[channel-facebook.md](channel-facebook.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="channel-instagram.md" %}
[channel-instagram.md](channel-instagram.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="channel-whatsapp.md" %}
[channel-whatsapp.md](channel-whatsapp.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Different users can visit your Channels!**

While your AI Chatbots are built to respond to any user when they access your Channel, remember that **different kinds of users can interact with your AI Chatbot**. When creating a Chat Flow for your AI Chatbot, consider these types of users:

* **Customers:** These are users who want to avail your service and/or products and may need your AI Chatbot to help them choose the right offerings.
* **Team:** These are members of your Team who interact with the AI Chatbot for the purposes of aiding internal operations. Interactions include directing the AI Chatbot to connect users to other agents, and the like.
* **Other Parties:** These are other types of users who might interact with your AI Chatbot for other purposes. These can include marketers who are checking your website in the hopes of a partnership, as well as potential stockholders and investors.
