**Make sure you have a Facebook Business Account!**

Our integration only works if you have a Facebook Business Account.

Make sure it is a **verified** account by following the steps in this [guide from Meta](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).

**Get a Twilio Paid Account!**

Crucial steps in this process, such as being able to create a WhatsApp Sender, is only possible with a Twilio Paid Account. After registering for your Twilio Free Account, please upgrade to a Twilio Paid Account.

You cannot use Captivate Chat to integrate your AI Chatbots to WhatsApp without Twilio.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Check for guide updates!**

Unlike other Chat Flows, connecting your AI Chatbot to WhatsApp needs you to use other platforms (Twilio, Meta Business Suite). Make sure to read updated guides and documentation about their processes for more in-depth instructions.&#x20;

In order to fill up the Account SID and Authentication Token, you have to **sign up for a Twilio** account.

Go to the **Twilio website** at [https://www.twilio.com/](https://www.twilio.com/)

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is Twilio?**

Twilio is a platform that uses web APIs to perform communication functions, such as text messaging and calls. Captivate Chat will automatically facilitate the connection between Twilio and your AI Chatbot.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>) and follow the instructions to register a new account. Youâ€™ll need to provide your email address and set a password. Afterwards, you have to:

* **Verify your email.** Check your email for a verification link from Twilio and click on it to verify your account.&#x20;
* **Verify your phone number.** Twilio will ask you to **verify your phone number.** Just follow the on-screen instructions. It will involve receiving a validation code.&#x20;
* **Upgrade your account.** Your free trial won't be able to support Twilio to WhatsApp integrations that we need for Captivate Chat. Go to the upper part of your Twilio Console and click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (175).png>), and follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade your account.&#x20;
