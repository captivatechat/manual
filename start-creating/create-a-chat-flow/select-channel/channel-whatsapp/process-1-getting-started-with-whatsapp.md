After going to the WhatsApp Senders menu, begin the process of creating your first WhatsApp Sender. To do this, you have to:&#x20;

1. Click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (179).png>)
2. Acknowledge and accept the Terms & Conditions presented in the new window.

### Select a Phone Number to register

Choose a phone number. This will be **your company's designated WhatsApp number specifically for talking to your AI Chatbot.**

You have two options:

* You can **buy a Twilio phone number**. Access Twilio's list of available numbers via ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>), then clicking ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>) and selecting ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>).
* You can **use your own number**. Twilio calls this process as **BYON (Bring Your Own Number)**. Please follow the instructions in [this Twilio guide](https://help.twilio.com/articles/360052171393-Can-I-register-my-own-phone-number-for-WhatsApp-on-Twilio-?\_gl=1\*br9h2a\*\_gcl\_au\*MTY0OTYxMjg3OC4xNzI0MjQ2Mzc5\*\_ga\*NjAwMDE0NDcuMTcyNDI0NjM3OQ..\*\_ga\_RRP8K4M4F3\*MTcyNTM3MzY2MS43LjEuMTcyNTM3Mzg0Ni4wLjAuMA..).

Twilio has its own [Guided Onboarding document](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/guided-onboarding) for a more in-depth look on this process, especially for steps outside Captivate Chat.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before selecting a number**

Take note of the Twilio warning before proceeding. Twilio has separate instructions if your phone number:

* ...is already connected to the WhatsApp consumer or small business app
* ...is already connected to the WhatsApp Business Platform via a different provider
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Buy a Twilio number according to your needs**

If you plan on purchasing a Twilio number, do take note that the service allows you to buy a phone number using different filters. You can choose according to country, capabilities (Voice, SMS, MMS, Fax), and advanced filters such as address requirements.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Get a phone number with SMS enabled**

Since we are going to integrate an AI Chatbot with WhatsApp, prioritize choosing a number with SMS enabled.&#x20;

### Link WhatsApp Business Account with your number

The next stage in the process involves **creating or select a pre-made WhatsApp Business Account** and verifying it to be used with Twilio.

#### 1. Link your WhatsApp Business Account

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (183).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will be prompted to connect your chosen number to a WhatsApp Business Account. Click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (184).png>) to start the setup process. Follow the instructions in the new window.

#### 2. Copy the phone number you want to register

#### 3. Verify the selected number with WhatsApp

Press the **Send Code** over in the Faceobok pop-up window. A verification code should automatically appear on the blank spaces below.&#x20;

Twilio should be attempting to register the phone number to WhatsApp. The process generally takes a few moments. The upper-right of the screen will provide these status messages:

### Find your new WhatsApp Sender

After verifying your new WhatsApp number, you will be redirected to your list of WhatsApp Senders. Your new WhatsApp sender should be in this list and ready to be integrated in a Captivate Chat Flow.

To create another WhatsApp sender, click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (180).png>) on the upper-right part of the menu.
