## Customize Web Chat

### Text Options

Customize the basic text that appears with your Chatbot once it becomes a Web Widget. This portion has the following components:

* **Title:** This is the "name" that users will see on the Chatbot.
* **Group Name:** This is the "public name of the Chatbot. You can name this after yourself, your team, or your company. In the image above, its name is _"Captivate Chat Bob."_&#x20;
* **Widget Text Description:** This is the invitational message your Chatbot reveals when users click it for the first time.&#x20;

### Color Options

Customize how your AI Chatbot appears in your website using a wide array of color options:

* **Primary Color**
* **Bubble Background** (User, Bot, Agent)
* **Chat Text** (User, Bot, Agent)
* **Chat Buttons** (Background, Text)

**Fit your Web Widget colors to your branding!**

Switch up your Web Widget colors to match your branding. Select the square icon beside the hexcodes to open a color palette where you can choose your preferred colors.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Image Options

Customize your Chatbot further with options that add "personality" to them. These include:

* **AI Chatbot Avatar:** This is how your Chatbot appears in the Web Widget.
* **Widget Icon:** This is how your Chatbot appears as an icon before expanding into a chat box. It can be the same icon as your AI Chatbot Avatar.&#x20;
* **AI Chatbot Business Image:** This represents the icon or logo of your branding or business.&#x20;
* **AI Chatbot Chat Header Image:** This is the unique background that comes with your AI Chatbot Avatar.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use high-quality resources**

Since your Chatbot is an extension of your branding, it's important to use high-quality resources such as images for elements such as your AI Chatbot Avatar and Business Image.

### Working Hours

Determine your Chatbot's working hours. You can choose its **Start Time** and **End Time**, and specific days of the week you want it to function. Here are your main considerations:

* **Disable Working Hours:** Toggling ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (169).png>) off means the Web Widget won't follow a schedule and **provide 24/7 coverage**. This is perfect if your Web Widget is designed solely to answer questions and not connect users with live agents.
* If you want your Chatbot to connect users to Live Agents, try to set the Chatbot's schedule to match that of your team's for a more seamless experience.

### Embed Live Chat

After setting the above options, we'll create an **embed code** you can copy and paste into your website.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Give your embed code to your Web Administrator**

Make sure that your embed is pasted **before the closing \</body> tag** on pages of your website where you want the AI Assistant to show up. Your Web Administrator should know how to make this work.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## You're all set!

Doing all the steps above should get your Chatbot ready to be used with a Web Widget.
