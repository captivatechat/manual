Once you name your Chat Flow, you will be taken to **Step 1: AI Assistant.**&#x20;

Select the AI Chatbot you want to be involved in this particular Chat Flow. Think of it as choosing the AI Chatbot that will interact with your audiences through your platform (your website or social media platform, to name a few). &#x20;

You are offered two choices:

## Create an AI Chatbot

You can create an AI Chatbot from scratch. Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png>), and you will be taken to the same steps of this page:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../create-an-ai-assistant/" %}
[create-an-ai-assistant](../create-an-ai-assistant/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Select an existing AI Chatbot

Click the Chatbot you want to use. Make sure it is fully functional.&#x20;

If you want to check its details, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (160).png>). It will take you to the same steps of this page:

{% content-ref url="../create-an-ai-assistant/import-your-own-information.md" %}
[import-your-own-information.md](../create-an-ai-assistant/import-your-own-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
