After selecting the active Chatbot in your Chat Flow, it's time to choose your **Channel**. This is where your users will encounter your AI Chatbot.&#x20;

We are offering different Channel Integrations into your Chat Flow, with different instructions how to set up each. Check each of them under the **\<Channel: \[Name]>** sub-pages, or through these links:

{% content-ref url="../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-web-widget.md" %}
[channel-web-widget.md](../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-web-widget.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-facebook.md" %}
[channel-facebook.md](../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-facebook.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-instagram.md" %}
[channel-instagram.md](../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-instagram.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-whatsapp.md" %}
[channel-whatsapp.md](../chat-flow-setting-up-channels/channel-whatsapp.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once done, click either ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (159).png>) or the _**Step 3: Live Chats**_ button on the left of the screen.
