Before you can fully integrate your AI Assistant with your Facebook Page, you have to fill up the following information:

* **Name:** This is the name of the AI Assistant as it will appear on Facebook.
* **Description:** Give your AI Assistant a short description.

### Sign in with Facebook

This is the most important step of the integration process. Click _**Sign in with Facebook.**_

You will encounter a separate window where you have to log in. Upon logging in, you then have to give Captivate Chat permissions to make modifications to your profile.

### Select the Business Account

Facebook will ask you the following:

* **"What pages do you want to use with Captivate Chat?"**
  * Choose the correct page.&#x20;

You will encounter a drop-down box where you will choose which page you specifically permit us to access. Choose the correct page and tick all the associated boxes.&#x20;

This will allow us to use our backend to automatically integrate your AI Assistant to your Facebook Page.&#x20;

### Fill up Page ID and Page Token
