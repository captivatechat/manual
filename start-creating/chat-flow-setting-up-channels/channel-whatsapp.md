In order to fill up the Account SID and Authentication Token, you have to **sign up for a Twilio** account.

Go to the **Twilio website** at [https://www.twilio.com/](https://www.twilio.com/)

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is Twilio?**

Twilio is a platform that uses web APIs to perform communication functions, such as text messaging and calls. Captivate Chat will automatically facilitate the connection between Twilio and your AI Chatbot.&#x20;

Click _**Sign Up**_ and follow the instructions to register a new account. Youâ€™ll need to provide your email address and set a password.&#x20;

**Verify your email.** Check your email for a verification link from Twilio and click on it to verify your account.&#x20;

<pre><code><strong>image
</strong></code></pre>

Log into Twilio. This will bring you to the **Twilio Console**, which serves as your main dashboard.

Twilio might ask you to **verify your phone number.** Just follow the on-screen instructions.&#x20;

### Request Access to the WhatsApp API

<pre><code><strong>image

**Locate the WhatsApp option in Twilio**.&#x20;

To do this, you have to:

1. Click _**Messaging**_ in the left-hand menu.&#x20;
2. From the drop down menu, find _**Senders > WhatsApp Senders**_
3. Click _**Create New Sender**_

<pre><code><strong>image
</strong></code></pre>

Follow the on-screen instructions to apply for WhatsApp access.&#x20;

These steps will mostly involve filling up the required details about your business so you can request access to the WhatsApp API.&#x20;

After doing this, Twilio will handle the actual setup process with WhatsApp.&#x20;

### Link a WhatsApp Number

<pre><code><strong>image
</strong></code></pre>

Once your request to link Twilio and WhatsApp is approved, you need to **add a phone number to use for WhatsApp messaging**.

In order to add a new number:

1. In the Twilio Console (dashboard), click _**Messaging > Senders > WhatsApp Senders.**_
2. Click _**Create New Sender**_.&#x20;

This will reveal on-screen instructions on how to link a phone number to your WhatsApp account.

### Link your Facebook Business Account

<pre><code><strong>image

After setting up your **New WhatsApp Sender**, Twilio will prompt you to link your account to an existing **Facebook Business Manager** account. This is a requirement from WhatsApp.&#x20;

<pre><code><strong>image

Follow the instructions that Twilio provides on the screen.&#x20;

This will involve providing permissions to access the Facebook Page you want to connect to WhatsApp.&#x20;
