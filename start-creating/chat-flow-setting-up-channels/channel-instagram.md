After _**Select Channel > Instagram**_, you will be taken to **Configure Instagram**. This is where you can integrate your AI Chatbot as the assigned bot of your Instagram Page.

**Make sure you have connected accounts**

Our integration only works if you have a **Professional Instagram Account** connected to a **Facebook Business Account.**
{% endhint %}

## Configure Instagram

Before you can fully integrate your AI Chatbot with your Instagram Page, you have to fill in the following information:

* **Name:** This is the name of the AI Chatbot as it will appear on Instagram
* **Description:** Give your AI Chatbot a short description.

### Sign in with Facebook

This is the most important step of the integration process. Click _**Sign in with Facebook.**_

You will encounter a separate window where you have to log in to Facebook. Upon logging in, you must give Captivate Chat permissions to modify your profile.

### Select the Business Account

Facebook will ask you the following:

* **"What Instagram Professional Accounts do you want to use with Captivate Chat?"**&#x20;
  * Choose the correct Instagram account.
* **"What pages do you want to use with Captivate Chat?"**
  * Choose the correct page.&#x20;

You will encounter a drop-down box where you will choose which **page** you specifically permit us to access. Choose the correct page and tick all the associated boxes.&#x20;

This will allow us to use our backend to automatically integrate your AI Assistant to your Instagram Page.&#x20;

### Fill up Instagram ID and Page Token

Back in **Configure Instagram**_,_ fill in the following:

* **Instagram Page Name:** Type the username of your target Instagram account.&#x20;
* **Instagram ID:** It should automatically appear.
* **Page Token:** It should automatically appear.

Click _**Next**_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Take note of your Instagram username**

When typing the Instagram Page Name, use your **username** - the name you use for tagging (with @). In the case of Captivate Chat, it's _captivatechat_.&#x20;

An easy reference is to check your Instagram Page via a web browser. The name located in the URL is your username. In the case of Captivate Chat, it's: [https://www.instagram.com/captivatechat/](https://www.instagram.com/captivatechat/)
{% endhint %}
