**Make sure you have connected accounts**

Our integration only works if you have a **Professional Instagram Account** connected to a **Facebook Business Account.**

## Configure Instagram

Before you can fully integrate your AI Assistant with your Instagram Page, you have to fill up the following information:

* **Name:** This is the name of the AI Assistant as it will appear on Instagram
* **Description:** Give your AI Assistant a short description.

### Sign in with Facebook

This is the most important step of the integration process. Click _**Sign in with Facebook.**_

You will encounter a separate window where you have to log in to Facebook. Upon logging in, you then have to give Captivate Chat permissions to make modifications to your profile.

### Select the Business Account

Facebook will ask you the following:

* **"What Instagram Business Accounts do you want to use with The Captivate Hub?"**&#x20;
  * Choose the correct Instagram account.
* **"What pages do you want to use with The Captivate Hub?"**
  * Choose the correct page.&#x20;

You will encounter a drop-down box where you will choose which **page** you specifically permit us to access. Choose the correct page and tick all the associated boxes.&#x20;

This will allow us to use our backend to automatically integrate your AI Assistant to your Instagram Page.&#x20;

### Fill up Instagram ID and Page Token

* **Instagram Page Name:** When you start typing your target Facebook Page, it should appear as a drop-down. Select it.
* **Instagram ID:** It should automatically appear.
* **Page Token:** It should automatically appear.

Click _**Next**_.
