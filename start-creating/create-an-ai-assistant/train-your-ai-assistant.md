Help your AI Chatbot learn and evolve from its knowledge base through **training**. Similar to how muscles are trained and "practiced" to get used to new activities, a AI Chatbot new interactions to "practice" its responses and learn from new knowledge.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Talk to your AI Chatbot - it literally uses your inputs to learn!**

Our AI Chatbots are capable of performing what's called **NLP** or natural language processing. This process combines their internal programming (machine learning) and linguistics to help them "learn" from interactions.&#x20;

Providing new questions and answers, as well as feedback, to your AI Chatbot slowly "shapes" its thought processes - allowing it to perform exactly how you need it to.&#x20;

The **Train your AI Assistant** has these major components:&#x20;
