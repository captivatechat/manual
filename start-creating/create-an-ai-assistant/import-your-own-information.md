# Import Your Own Information

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The menu where you can view all information uploaded to your Chatbot</p></figcaption></figure>

Importing your own information is the most important step in AI Chatbot creation. This is what the bot uses to answer user questions.

Make sure the information you will include has everything you want the Chatbot to use as a reference. In-depth sources can provide more accurate and reliable responses from your new Chatbot.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The more the merrier!**

Think of this process as building the encyclopedia your Chatbot will rely on when answering customers. Since your Chatbot is an "intelligent" model, it knows how to combine information from different sources. This is where you come in. \
\
The more resources you provide, the more information your Chatbot can access when creating responses!
{% endhint %}

To start adding data to your chatbot, click  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1).png>)

### Adding files and URLs to import

A pop-up window should appear. You can either:

* **Import:** Click or drag **PDF files** (up to 100MB) that contains important information that your Chatbot should know. You can drag multiple files at once by selecting a group of files and dragging them all to the file import area.
* **URL(s):** List a set of URLs (one URL per line) that will become the basis of the knowledge of your Chatbot.&#x20;

Once you have completed the files or webpages you want to import click on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png>)button.

You will be asked to pay a number of tokens to ingest the URL or PDF you've just uploaded. Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (255).png>) to proceed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Import limit**

We limit the number of imports to support **a combination of up to 20 Files and URLs.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only PDF files allowed**

We only support **PDF files** as of the moment. If you have data in some other format such as a **DOCX** (MS Word) or **PPTX** (MS Powerpoint) file, simply save those files as **PDFs** and import the PDF file.
{% endhint %}

### The import process

After clicking the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png>)button, you will then see a list of the files or URL(s) being imported. Wait patiently as the information is ingested. Here are the status updates throughout the importation process:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Please be patient. The time taken to import a PDF file or URL is dependent upon the size of the file or webpage.  You can return to import further information or remove information at any time. &#x20;

### Focus only on ingested data

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One additional feature is the ability to focus your AI Chatbot on just the data that you have imported. This can be done by toggling **Active/Inactive** at the right hand side of the screen.&#x20;

The underlying AI Platform will take note of this and behave as requested in most circumstances but like us humans may not be able to help itself sometimes.

Once your data has been imported, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1).png>)
