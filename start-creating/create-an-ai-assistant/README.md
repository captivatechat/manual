# Create an AI Assistant

You can use the Captivate Chat platform to **create your AI Assistants**. They can be custom-tailored to fit specific functionalities, fed information to improve their knowledge base, and trained with specific questions and answers.&#x20;

To create your AI Assistant, proceed with the following steps:

***

## Setting Up

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>+AI Assistant</em> button</p></figcaption></figure>

Under the **Setup > AI Assistant** view, click _**+AI Assistant**_.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You can give your new AI Assistant a Name and a Logo</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window should appear. Under **New AI Assistant**, fill up the following:

* **Name Your AI Assistant:** Assign a name to your AI Assistant that corresponds to your needs.&#x20;
* **Upload Logo:** This will remind you the purpose of the bot. Your logo should be square and of moderate resolution (e.g. 100 pixels x 100 pixels). You can remove the logo by clicking on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png>) and replace it at any time.&#x20;

Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>) when you're finished.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Naming is important!**

If you plan on making multiple Chatbots, naming and labeling them with a Name and Logo makes them easier to organize.&#x20;

You may wish to use a version number or some other standard that makes it easier to follow the meaning of the bot. For example, “My Bot v1.0”
{% endhint %}

***

## Change the Name and Logo anytime

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you work through the steps to define your AI Chatbot you can edit its Name or Logo by clicking on the **pencil icon** **(** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>) **)** in the field at the top of the page.&#x20;

***

## Select AI Platform

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Available options for an AI Platform include OpenAI, AWS Lex, and IBM Watson Assistant</p></figcaption></figure>

After naming your AI Assistant, you will be taken to the **AI Assistant** view. This is where you will customize the features of your new Chatbot.&#x20;

Choose the AI Platform you want as the basis of your Chatbot. This determines the kind of programming used by your AI Assistant.

After you've made your choice, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**As of 8/26/2024**

We removed the _**Select AI Platform**_ part of our current process. After naming your AI Chatbot, you will be sent straight to _**Import Your Own Information**_.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**As of 8/22/2024**

We are currently only offering **OpenAI** as the AI Platform of our AI Assistants. More platforms will be unlocked soon, and we'll explain their differences once they arrive!
{% endhint %}

***

## Import Your Own Information

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The menu where you can view all information uploaded to your Chatbot</p></figcaption></figure>

Importing your own information is the most important step in AI Chatbot creation. This is what the bot uses to answer user questions.

Make sure the information you will include has everything you want the Chatbot to use as a reference. In-depth sources can provide more accurate and reliable responses from your new Chatbot.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The more the merrier!**

Think of this process as building the encyclopedia your Chatbot will rely on when answering customers. Since your Chatbot is an "intelligent" model, it knows how to combine information from different sources. This is where you come in. \
\
The more resources you provide, the more information your Chatbot can access when creating responses!
{% endhint %}

To start adding data to your chatbot, click  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

### Adding files and URLs to import

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the Import menu to add files and/or URLs to your Chatbot's database</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window should appear. You can either:

* **Import:** Click or drag **PDF files** (up to 100MB) that contains important information that your Chatbot should know. You can drag multiple files at once by selecting a group of files and dragging them all to the file import area.
* **URL(s):** List a set of URLs (one URL per line) that will become the basis of the knowledge of your Chatbot.&#x20;

Once you have completed the files or webpages you want to import click on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)button.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Import limit**

We limit the number of imports to support **a combination of up to 20 Files and URLs.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only PDF files allowed**

We only support **PDF files** as of the moment. If you have data in some other format such as a **DOCX** (MS Word) or **PPTX** (MS Powerpoint) file, simply save those files as **PDFs** and import the PDF file.
{% endhint %}

### The import process

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After clicking the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)button, you will then see a list of the files or URL(s) being imported. Wait patiently as the information is ingested. Here are the status updates throughout the importation process:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Please be patient. The time taken to import a PDF file or URL is dependent upon the size of the file or webpage.  You can return to import further information or remove information at any time. &#x20;

### Focus only on ingested data

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One additional feature is the ability to focus your AI Chatbot on just the data that you have imported. This can be done by toggling **Active/Inactive** at the right hand side of the screen.&#x20;

The underlying AI Platform will take note of this and behave as requested in most circumstances but like us humans may not be able to help itself sometimes.

Once your data has been imported, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

***

## Select Type

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select the kind of AI Assistant you want to create</p></figcaption></figure>

Check our list if there's any template that corresponds to the kind of AI Chatbot you want to create.&#x20;

We've already prepared AI Chatbot types you can select to meet specific functionalities. They are pre-programmed with behaviors to help them approach questions and tasks a specific way, making them "plug-and-play" for your convenience.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select your AI Chatbot type by **clicking on the tile** you're interested in.

### The different AI Chatbot types

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (108).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The many kinds of AI Assistants you can create</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's a more in-depth description of each AI Assistant Type:&#x20;

* **Marketing Bot:** Assist in marketing and recommending products, specifically serving sales representatives dealing with prospective customers.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use an AI Assistant Type for your first time!**

If this is your first time creating your own AI Assistant, consider using one of our AI Assistant Types. They are made specifically to help you meet a specific need as quickly as possible, so you can start integrating new functionalities to your website or business.&#x20;

You can always create more elaborate AI Assistants later!
{% endhint %}

### Customize your AI Chatbot type

Modify your AI Chatbot even further by clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)  **after you've made your choice of AI Chatbot variant.** This brings you to a new window with customizable parameters, as seen below:&#x20;

#### Customize Type (Structured)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Structured format of customizing your AI Assistant</p></figcaption></figure>

Clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>) allows you to modify the parameters of the AI Chatbot type you've chosen. This allows you to dictate exactly how you want your AI Chatbot to "think" and engage users.&#x20;

Under the **Structured tab**, we have prepared forms you can fill out with more specific instructions that you want the Chatbot to follow:&#x20;

* **Personality:** What kind of personality do you want the AI Chatbot to have when they interact with users? Are they professional, formal, or casual?&#x20;
* **Input Instructions:** What should the AI Chatbot expect when they analyze the questions or queries of users? How should they approach the thinking process?
* **Output Instructions:** What sort of output should the AI Chatbot provide users? How should they use the information they have to answer the user's query?
* **Output Format:** Do you have any specific format for the AI Chatbot to follow when they create responses? Should your responses focus on providing lists or paragraphs of text?

{% hint style="info" %}
**How should your AI Chatbot process the information it receives?**

While you've uploaded a lot of information in your AI Chatbot, they don't know how to process it yet. If you want your Chatbot to process the information a certain way, this is where you can edit it.&#x20;

You can find some inspiration from the preset answers included in the AI Assistant Type you've chosen.
{% endhint %}

#### Customize Type (Free Format)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Free Format layout of customizing your AI Assistant Type</p></figcaption></figure>

Alternatively, you can choose the **Free Format tab** to create your own instructions. There is a sample in the **Custom Prompts** text box so you can have a basis on how you can instruct your customized AI Chatbot.

The **Custom Prompts** text box is a fully customizable prompt with no formatting, allowing you to write elaborate instructions without the constraints of the Structured format.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Be as elaborate in your prompts as you want!**

A **prompt** is a series of instructions that your AI Chatbot uses as a basis of its "thought process." Prompts can be as simple as asking the AI Chatbot to do something, or as complex as giving it a set of elaborate instructions.&#x20;

We can create in-depth prompting guides to help you develop more elaborate Chatbots!
{% endhint %}

You can proceed with the next step in two (2) ways:

* From the original _**Select Type**_ view, choose ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>) on the lower right-hand corner.
* In the _**Customize Type**_ view, choose ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>) on the lower right-hand corner.&#x20;

## Train your AI Assistant

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Train your Chatbot using the <em>Train your AI Assistant</em> menu</p></figcaption></figure>

Help your AI Chatbot learn and evolve from its knowledge base through **training**. Similar to how muscles are trained and "practiced" to get used to new activities, a AI Chatbot new interactions to "practice" its responses and learn from new knowledge.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Talk to your AI Chatbot - it literally uses your inputs to learn!**

Our AI Chatbots are capable of performing what's called **NLP** or natural language processing. This process combines their internal programming (machine learning) and linguistics to help them "learn" from interactions.&#x20;

Providing new questions and answers, as well as feedback, to your AI Chatbot slowly "shapes" its thought processes - allowing it to perform exactly how you need it to.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The **Train your AI Assistant** has these major components:&#x20;

### Enter your test question

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Write a test question that will gauge the Chatbot's response based on the current information in its knowledge base.

Once done, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)

### **Current Answer**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will contain a response based on the Chatbot's current database.

### **Correct Answer**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You should insert the correct answer to your question, if the response given is wrong or has to be modified.

Once done, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

### Trained Questions and Answers

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The list of trained Questions, Answers, and Messages will be listed here</p></figcaption></figure>

The **Trained Questions and Anwers** contain the list of Questions, Correct Answers, and Messages that have been inserted by the user.&#x20;

### **+Add with CSV**

Insert your own list of questions and answers as a CSV file instead of manually typing them.  To do this, click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Submit more specific Q&#x26;A files using this menu </p></figcaption></figure>

After clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png>), a pop-up window should appear.

In **Submit additional Q\&A:**&#x20;

* Drag the appropriate CSV (up to 100MB) containing the list of training questions and answers.
* Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)
