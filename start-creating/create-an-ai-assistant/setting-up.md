A pop-up window should appear. Under **New AI Assistant**, fill up the following:

* **Name Your AI Assistant:** Assign a name to your AI Assistant that corresponds to your needs.&#x20;
* **Upload Logo:** This will remind you the purpose of the bot. Your logo should be square and of moderate resolution (e.g. 100 pixels x 100 pixels). You can remove the logo by clicking on the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png>) and replace it at any time.&#x20;

Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png>) when you're finished.

**Naming is important!**

If you plan on making multiple Chatbots, naming and labeling them with a Name and Logo makes them easier to organize.&#x20;

You may wish to use a version number or some other standard that makes it easier to follow the meaning of the bot. For example, “My Bot v1.0”
