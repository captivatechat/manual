### Customize your AI Chatbot type

Modify your AI Chatbot even further by clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)  **after you've made your choice of AI Chatbot variant.** This brings you to a new window with customizable parameters, as seen below:&#x20;

#### Customize Type (Structured)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Structured format of customizing your AI Assistant</p></figcaption></figure>

Clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>) allows you to modify the parameters of the AI Chatbot type you've chosen. This allows you to dictate exactly how you want your AI Chatbot to "think" and engage users.&#x20;

Under the **Structured tab**, we have prepared forms you can fill out with more specific instructions that you want the Chatbot to follow:&#x20;

* **Personality:** What kind of personality do you want the AI Chatbot to have when they interact with users? Are they professional, formal, or casual?&#x20;
* **Input Instructions:** What should the AI Chatbot expect when they analyze the questions or queries of users? How should they approach the thinking process?
* **Output Instructions:** What sort of output should the AI Chatbot provide users? How should they use the information they have to answer the user's query?
* **Output Format:** Do you have any specific format for the AI Chatbot to follow when they create responses? Should your responses focus on providing lists or paragraphs of text?

{% hint style="info" %}
**How should your AI Chatbot process the information it receives?**

While you've uploaded a lot of information in your AI Chatbot, they don't know how to process it yet. If you want your Chatbot to process the information a certain way, this is where you can edit it.&#x20;

You can find some inspiration from the preset answers included in the AI Assistant Type you've chosen.
{% endhint %}

#### Customize Type (Free Format)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Free Format layout of customizing your AI Assistant Type</p></figcaption></figure>

Alternatively, you can choose the **Free Format tab** to create your own instructions. There is a sample in the **Custom Prompts** text box so you can have a basis on how you can instruct your customized AI Chatbot.

The **Custom Prompts** text box is a fully customizable prompt with no formatting, allowing you to write elaborate instructions without the constraints of the Structured format.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Be as elaborate in your prompts as you want!**

A **prompt** is a series of instructions that your AI Chatbot uses as a basis of its "thought process." Prompts can be as simple as asking the AI Chatbot to do something, or as complex as giving it a set of elaborate instructions.&#x20;

We can create in-depth prompting guides to help you develop more elaborate Chatbots!
{% endhint %}

You can proceed with the next step in two (2) ways:

* From the original _**Select Type**_ view, choose ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>) on the lower right-hand corner.
* In the _**Customize Type**_ view, choose ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>) on the lower right-hand corner.&#x20;
