Here are the kinds of custom components our clients often ask us to make:

* **AI Assistant:** Choose this if you want a specific type of AI Chatbot outside our available templates.
* **Live Chat:** If your company has a specific software or product that facilitates your Live Chats, you can choose this option.
* **Bespoke AI:** Select this If the AI tool you designed doesn't fit "quite right" in the context of being an AI Assistant.
* **Other:** Choose this if you have a specific functionality or software in mind that doesn't fall under the previous categories. Examples include:
  * **AI Platform:** Do you have a preferred AI Platform aside from IBM Watson, AWS Lex, and OpenAI?&#x20;
