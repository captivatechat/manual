description: Connect your Chat Flow to Microsoft Teams

# Microsoft Teams

Once you’ve prepared your Chat Flow with an AI Chatbot and a Channel of your choice, connecting it to your Microsoft Teams account can be accomplished in just a few steps.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Your Microsoft Teams email and Captivate Chat account email must be the same!**

In order for our MS Teams Live Chat integration to work, your Microsoft Teams email and Captivate Chat email must match.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Setting Up

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (193).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Log into your Microsoft Teams.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (194).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the left-side toolbar, click **Apps**.&#x20;

A new window will load that contains available applications you can integrate to your Microsoft Teams.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (196).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the search bar, look for “Captivate Chat.”

Wait for the screen to load. An app called Captivate Chat should appear and look like the one in the picture above.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (197).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png>) on the upper right side of the application. It will open a pop-up window containing the application page.

Proceed with the installation by clicking ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>) below the name.&#x20;

As the app is installed, this button transforms into ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png>).&#x20;





Once complete, a new window will appear. Click Open.

\[]

A chat window for Captivate Chat will appear. This is Captivate Chat’s own AI Chabot for MS Teams integration.

## MS Teams Integration



\[]

In the textbox below, type “signin.”&#x20;

\[]

Our AI Chatbot will provide two responses.&#x20;

\[]

Under the first response, click I Agree.&#x20;

\[]

It will provide a follow-up message. Click Admin Consent.

\[]

A new window will appear. This will provide a list of things you will allow Captivate Chat to access. Click Accept.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**We value your data!**

Captivate Chat won’t sell your information to third-party apps and services.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

\[]

After providing consent, a new message will appear. You will be redirected to your chat in Microsoft Teams.&#x20;

\[]

You have to choose how you want to log in to your Captivate Chat account. You can either:

* Sign Up to create a Captivate Chat account.
* Sign in via Teams if you want to login straight from your Microsoft Teams app.
* Sign in via Web if you want to login via your web browser.
* Help to seek further assistance.

Click Sign in via Teams.

\[]

Wait for a few moments. A new message will appear. You have successfully logged into your Captivate Chat account into Microsoft Teams.

\[]

It’s time to connect your Chat Flow!

In the same conversation with the Captivate Chat app, you will be prompted to connect a Chat Flow to Microsoft Teams.&#x20;

Click Link.

\[]

Wait for the response. A new message called Connect your team to a hub will appear that contains a drop-down list. This has all the Chat Flows you created in Captivate Chat so far.

Choose the Chat Flow you want to connect to your Microsoft Teams account.

Click Submit.

\[]

It will say “Okay, connecting…” Wait for this to finish.&#x20;

\[]

A new message will say Hub connection created! This means you’ve finished connecting your Captivate Chat Flow to your Microsoft Teams account.

#### Your MS Teams Chat Flow

\[]

Go to your Teams in your left-side dashboard. You should see the following:

* Chat Flow Name (Chat Group): A new chat group with the same name as your Captivate Chat Flow.
* Agent Name (Live Agent): This is a conversation dedicated to a Live Agent assigned to respond to users in your Captivate Chat Flow. The first agent is named after you, the creator of the Chat Flow.&#x20;

**Chat Flow Name**

\[]

This is a new chat group with the same name as your Captivate Chat Flow.

The chat group also contains the General chat. This contains all updates to the Chat Flow. All incoming conversations from users are sent here first before being reallocated to an agent.&#x20;

The General chat is where you can use commands to assign user conversations to Live Agents and make other adjustments to your Chat Flow from the Microsoft Teams side.

**Agent Name**

\[]

This is a chat group dedicated to all user conversations that are transferred to the Live Agent via the Chat Flow. The first agent is named after you, the creator of the Chat Flow. It has the following components:&#x20;

* General: All changes that specifically happen to this Live Agent are listed here.&#x20;
* User Name: Each user assigned to this Live Agent gets a unique conversation within the chat group. Messages typed here are relayed to the AI Chatbot, which then relays the information to users via their conversation in the Channel.&#x20;

#### Test your new MS Teams Chat Flow

Now that you’ve successfully integrated your Chat Flow to your Microsoft Teams, you have to test to see if it’s working.&#x20;

In order to do this, you have to do the following:

**Try requesting for a Live Agent via your Channel**

\[]

Go to the Channel assigned to the Chat Flow you just connected.&#x20;

In this case, we used a Web Widget so we can preview it straight from the My Chat Flow list in the Captivate Chat website.

\[]

Start a conversation with the AI Chatbot assigned to that Channel. Ask for a Live Agent. You can do this using these methods:

* Type the request directly. Write “I want to talk to an agent” or another derivative you can think of.
* Click Chat to person. This option is available as a separate command on the Web Widget, but can be an interactive button in other Channels (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp).

\[]

Wait for the AI Chatbot to respond. It will ask you for two things for record-keeping purposes:

* Your name
* Your email address

\[]

The AI Chatbot will give a default message asking for the user to wait.

\


{% hint style="warning" %}
**Use an alternate email for this test!**

When testing your MS Teams integration, make sure you’re using a different email when talking to your AI Chatbot. This allows you to recreate a scenario where a user with a personal email is inquiring to your AI Chatbot about your services.
{% endhint %}



**Respond to the query via Microsoft Teams**

\[]

Go to Microsoft Teams. Wait for the Chat Flow > General to receive an update.&#x20;

Since you’re the only Live Agent in your Chat Flow for now, the update will state that the test conversation will automatically be assigned to you.

\[]

Greet the user.

\[]

Check the conversation between the AI Chatbot and your test user in the Channel.&#x20;

There should be a prompt that says Agent (Your Name) joins the conversation.

\[]

Back in Microsoft Teams, wait for the initial conversation between your AI Chatbot and user to load. This should give you enough context about the user’s needs.

\[]

Once all the messages have loaded, use the Agent Name > User Name chat in Microsoft Teams to converse like how you’d normally ask a query to a website. Check if the conversation in the Channel is being updated.
