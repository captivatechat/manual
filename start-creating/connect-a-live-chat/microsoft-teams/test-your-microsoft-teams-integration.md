# Test your Microsoft Teams integration

Now that you’ve successfully integrated your Chat Flow to your Microsoft Teams, you have to test to see if it’s working.&#x20;

In order to do this, you have to do the following:

## **Request for a Live Agent via your Channel**

Go to the Channel assigned to the Chat Flow you just connected.&#x20;

In this case, we used a Web Widget for "_**Roof Buddy v2 ChatFlow."**_&#x20;

This means we can preview it straight from the My Chat Flow list in the Captivate Chat website.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Forgot how to preview a Web Widget?**

If you forgot how to preview a Web Widget, refer to [preview-your-web-widget.md](../../create-a-chat-flow/select-channel/channel-web-widget/preview-your-web-widget.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

Start a conversation with the AI Chatbot assigned to that Channel. Ask for a Live Agent. You can do this using these methods:

* **Type the request directly.** Write _“I want to talk to an agent”_ or another derivative you can think of.
* **Click** ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (219).png>)**.** This option is available as a separate command on the Web Widget but can be an interactive button in other Channels (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp).

Wait for the AI Chatbot to respond. It will ask you for two (2) things for record-keeping purposes:

* Your name
* Your email address

The AI Chatbot will give a default message asking for the user to wait.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Use an alternate email for this test!**

When testing your MS Teams integration, make sure you’re using a different email when talking to your AI Chatbot. This allows you to recreate a scenario where a user with a personal email is inquiring to your AI Chatbot about your services.
{% endhint %}

## **Respond to the query via Microsoft Teams**

Go to Microsoft Teams. Wait for the **Chat Flow > General** to receive an update.&#x20;

Since you’re the only Live Agent in your Chat Flow for now, the update will state that the test conversation will automatically be assigned to you.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (225).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Greet the user.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (228).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After greeting the user, Captivate Chat will transition your conversation into a separate chat under your **Agent Name** group chat. The new conversation will have the name of the user you're currently talking to.&#x20;

## Check the dialogue in your Channel

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (224).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check the Channel to view the conversation between the AI Chatbot and your test user.&#x20;

There should be a message that says "_**Agent (Your Name) joins the conversation**_," alongside the greeting you sent over via Microsoft Teams.

## Wait for the MS Teams App to load your current conversation

Back in Microsoft Teams, wait for the initial conversation between your AI Chatbot and user to load. This should give you enough context about the user’s needs.

Once all the messages have loaded, continue the conversation to test your AI Chatbot. \
