# Microsoft Teams

Once you’ve prepared your Chat Flow with an AI Chatbot and a Channel of your choice, connecting it to your Microsoft Teams account can be accomplished in just a few steps.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Your Microsoft Teams email and Captivate Chat account email must be the same!**

In order for our MS Teams Live Chat integration to work, your Microsoft Teams email and Captivate Chat email must match.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**A Channel in Captivate Chat is different than the "channel" in Microsoft Teams**

In this particular section of the guide, you might encounter the word `channel`used by both Captivate Chat and Microsoft Teams.

**Channels** in Captivate Chat pertain to avenues where an AI Chatbot is deployed - whether web widget or social media.&#x20;

Meanwhile, **channels** in Microsoft Teams pertain to chat groups for organizations.&#x20;

**To avoid confusion**, we will be spelling "channels" for Microsoft Teams in small caps, and "Channels" for Captivate Chat in large caps.&#x20;

## Setting Up

On the search bar, look for “Captivate Chat.”

Wait for the screen to load. An app called Captivate Chat should appear and look like the one in the picture above. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png>) on the upper right side of the application.&#x20;

This will open a pop-up window containing the application page.

Proceed with the installation by clicking ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>) below the name.&#x20;

As the app is installed, this button transforms into ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png>).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (247).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once complete, a new window will appear. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (249).png>).

A chat window for Captivate Chat will appear. This is Captivate Chat’s own dedicated app for MS Teams integration.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Choose the Microsoft Teams channel where you want the app to be used!**

Microsoft Teams allows you to open the Captivate Chat MS Teams App to be opened across different "channels."&#x20;

Select your preferred channel, especially if you have different Microsoft Teams organizations.
