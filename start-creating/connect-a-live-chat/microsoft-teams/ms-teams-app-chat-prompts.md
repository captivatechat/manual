# MS Teams App Chat Prompts

With the Captivate Chat MS Teams App, you can start linking and unlinking Chat Flows directly into the Microsoft Teams of your organization. You can do these, among other things, through the built-in **prompts** in the app.

When you start a conversation with the Captivate Chat MS Teams App, you can perform various actions through its different prompts:

## Help

`help` provides the list of all prompts you can use within the app.

## Start

`start` is best used if you open the Captivate Chat app for the first time and the Chatbot didn't initiate a conversation. You have two (2) options:

### If you are not logged in

Typing `start` if you are not logged in will provide this window. This process is identical to the `signin` command.

**When is it best to use this command?**

If you're using the Captivate Chat MS Teams App for the first time, you will usually get sent straight to `signin`.&#x20;

However, `start` is useful if the app didn't load anything after being opened.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### If you are logged in

Typing `start` if you are already logged in will provide this window. This process is identical to the `link` command.

## Signin

`signin` will prompt Captivate Chat to log you into your Captivate Chat account. You can do this in different ways:

### Sign in via Teams

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (236).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Clicking ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (237).png>) will prompt the app to check if your Microsoft Teams email is connected to an existing Captivate Chat account.&#x20;

If this is the case, the Captivate Chat MS Teams App will make an automatic connection.

### Sign up

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (233).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (238).png>) if you don't have a Captivate Chat account.&#x20;

You will be asked to allow Captivate Chat to open a new window. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (239).png>) and follow the registration instructions.

### Sign in via Web

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (234).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (240).png>) to log in to Captivate Chat directly from your web browser.&#x20;

You will be asked if the Captivate Chat will be allowed to open a browser window. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (239).png>) and follow the login instructions.

## Link

`link` allows you to connect a Chat Flow to your Microsoft Teams organization.

After entering the command, wait for our Chatbot's response. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (206).png>). This prompts a new message that lets you choose a Chat Flow from a drop-down menu.&#x20;

Once you've made your choice, click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (205).png>). Wait for a few seconds for Captivate Chat to connect your Chat Flow to your Microsoft Teams organization.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Connect any number of Chat Flows into your Microsoft Teams organization**

You can use Captivate Chat to connect Chat Flows into your Microsoft Teams organization. That way, AI Chatbots in different Channels (like your website, social media) can ask for live agents directly via Captivate Chat.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Unlink

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (202).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`unlink` removes the connection between Microsoft Teams and your chosen Chat Flow.

After sending this prompt, Captivate Chat will ask you to choose **a combination of Team and Chat Flow** you want to unlink.&#x20;

Once you've made your choice, click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (204).png>).

## Signout

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (235).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`signout` logs you out of your Captivate Chat account.&#x20;

After typing the prompt, simply wait for a few seconds for the chatbot to respond.
