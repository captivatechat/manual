After you linked your Chat Flow to the Captivate Chat MS Teams App, look at the left-side dashboard of Microsoft Teams.

The app will create these new chats:&#x20;

* **Chat Flow Name (Chat Group):** A new chat group with the same name as your Captivate Chat Flow. In the above image, this is _**"Roof Buddy v2 ChatFlow."**_
* **Agent Name (Live Agent):** This is a conversation dedicated to a Live Agent assigned to respond to users in your Captivate Chat Flow. The first agent is named after you, the creator of the Chat Flow. In the above image, this is _**"CH Agent Rob."**_

### **Chat Flow Name**

This is a new chat group with the same name as your Captivate Chat Flow.

The chat group also contains the General chat. This contains all updates to the Chat Flow. All incoming conversations from users are sent here first before being reallocated to an agent.&#x20;

The General chat is where you can use commands to assign user conversations to Live Agents and make other adjustments to your Chat Flow from the Microsoft Teams side.

### **Agent Name**

This is a chat group dedicated to all user conversations that are transferred to the Live Agent via the Chat Flow. The first agent is named after you, the creator of the Chat Flow. It has the following components:&#x20;

* **General:** All changes that specifically happen to this Live Agent are listed here.&#x20;
* **User Name:** Each user assigned to this Live Agent gets a unique conversation within the chat group. Messages typed here are relayed to the AI Chatbot, which then relays the information to users via their conversation in the Channel.&#x20;
