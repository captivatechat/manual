# Create an AI Assistant

You can use the Captivate Chat platform to **create your AI Assistants**. They can be custom-tailored to fit specific functionalities, fed information to improve their knowledge base, and trained with specific questions and answers.&#x20;

To create your AI Assistant, proceed with the following steps:

***

## Setting Up

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>+AI Assistant</em> button</p></figcaption></figure>

Under the **Setup > AI Assistant** view, click _**+AI Assistant**_.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>You can give your new AI Assistant a Name and a Logo</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window should appear. Under **New AI Assistant**, fill up the following:

* **Name Your AI Assistant:** Assign a name to your AI Assistant that corresponds to your needs.&#x20;
* **Upload Logo:** The AI Assistant can have an associated image to make them easier to find. Use the upload button to select an appropriate image.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Naming is important!**

If you plan on making multiple Chatbots, naming and labeling them with a Name & Icon makes them easier to organize.&#x20;

For instance, your website Chatbot can have your company name. Meanwhile, an AI Assistant representing a new service can have a dedicated Chatbot name.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Click **Done** when you're finished.

***

## Customizing your AI Assistant

After naming your AI Assistant, you will be taken to the **AI Assistant** view. This is where you will customize the features of your new Chatbot.&#x20;

### Select AI Platform

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Available options for an AI Platform include OpenAI, AWS Lex, and IBM Watson Assistant</p></figcaption></figure>

Choose the AI Platform you want as the basis of your Chatbot. This determines the kind of programming used by your AI Assistant.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**As of 8/22/2024**

We are currently only offering **OpenAI** as the AI Platform of our AI Assistants. More platforms will be unlocked soon, and we'll explain their differences once they arrive!
{% endhint %}

### Import Your Own Information

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The menu where you can view all information uploaded to your Chatbot</p></figcaption></figure>

Build the knowledge base of your AI Assistant by uploading datasets that will be the basis of its core responses and interactions.&#x20;

Make sure the information you will include has everything you want the Chatbot to use as a reference. In-depth sources can provide more accurate and reliable responses from your new Chatbot.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The more the merrier!**

Think of this process as building the encyclopedia your Chatbot will rely on when answering customers. Since your Chatbot is an "intelligent" model, it knows how to combine information from different sources. This is where you come in. \
\
The more resources you provide, the more information your Chatbot can access when creating responses!
{% endhint %}

Click _**Import Your Own Information**_.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use the Import menu to add files and/or URLs to your Chatbot's database</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window should appear. You can either:

* **Import:** Click or drag a relevant file (up to 100MB) that contains important information that your Chatbot should know.
* **URL(s):** List a set of URLs (one URL per line) that will become the basis of the knowledge of your Chatbot.&#x20;

### Select Type

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select the kind of AI Assistant you want to create</p></figcaption></figure>

Check our list if there's any template that corresponds to the kind of Chatbot you want to create.&#x20;

We've already prepared AI Assistant Types you can select to meet specific functionalities. They are pre-programmed with behaviors to help them approach questions and tasks a specific way, making them "plug-and-play" for your convenience.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (108).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The many kinds of AI Assistants you can create</p></figcaption></figure>

Here's a more in-depth description of each AI Assistant Type:&#x20;

* **Marketing Bot:** Assist in marketing and recommending products, specifically serving sales representatives dealing with prospective customers.&#x20;
* **Customer Support Bot:** Deliver technical support to customer representatives.&#x20;
* **Learning Assistant Bot:** Offer educational content on IT products and services, including linking to relevant resources and adapting to the learner's specific needs.&#x20;
* **Business Intelligence Bot:** Supply employees with instant, actionable insights on market trends, performance metrics, and operational data.&#x20;
* **Social Media Assistant** Bot: Aid businesses in mastering their social media landscape, facilitating audience engagement, and refining content strategies.&#x20;
* **Project Management Assistant Bot:** Facilitate project planning, tracking, and collaboration among team members.&#x20;
* **School Receptionist:** Helpfully answer questions from parents about school matters.&#x20;
* **Multiple Choice Bot:** Help students prepare for an exam. You will make sure that your opening will be a multiple-choice question with the provided format.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use an AI Assistant Type for your first time!**

If this is your first time creating your own AI Assistant, consider using one of our AI Assistant Types. They are made specifically to help you meet a specific need as quickly as possible, so you can start integrating new functionalities to your website or business.&#x20;

You can always create more elaborate AI Assistants later!
{% endhint %}

#### Customize Type (Structured)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Structured format of customizing your AI Assistant</p></figcaption></figure>

Clicking _**Customize (Advanced)**_ allows you to modify the parameters of the AI Assistant type you've chosen. This allows you to dictate exactly how you want your Chatbot to "think" and engage users.&#x20;

Under the **Structured** format, we have prepared forms you can fill out with more specific instructions that you want the Chatbot to follow:&#x20;

* **Personality:** What kind of personality do you want the Chatbot to have when they interact with users? Are they professional, formal, or casual?&#x20;
* **Input Instructions:** What should the Chatbot expect when they analyze the questions or queries of users? How should they approach the thinking process?
* **Output Instructions:** What sort of output should the Chatbot provide users? How should they use the information they have to answer the user's query?
* **Output Format:** Do you have any specific format for the Chatbot to follow when they create responses? Should your responses focus on providing lists or paragraphs of text?

{% hint style="info" %}
**How should your Chatbot process the information it receives?**

While you've uploaded a lot of information in your Chatbot, they don't know how to process it yet. If you want your Chatbot to process the information a certain way, this is where you can edit it.&#x20;

You can find some inspiration from the preset answers included in the AI Assistant Type you've chosen.
{% endhint %}

#### Customize Type (Free Format)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Free Format layout of customizing your AI Assistant Type</p></figcaption></figure>

Alternatively, you can toggle **Free Format** to create your own prompt.&#x20;

The initial text that appears in **Custom Prompts** is a compilation of responses inside the Structured format clustered together in a paragraph. However, you can use Custom Prompts to create more elaborate instructions.&#x20;

* **Custom Prompts**: This is a fully customizable prompt with no formatting, allowing you to write elaborate instructions without the constraints of the Structured format.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Be as elaborate in your prompts as you want!**

A **prompt** is a series of instructions that your Chatbot uses as a basis of its "thought process." Prompts can be as simple as asking the Chatbot to do something, or as complex as giving it a set of elaborate instructions.&#x20;

We can create in-depth prompting guides to help you develop more elaborate Chatbots!
{% endhint %}

## Training your AI Assistant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Train your Chatbot using the <em>Train your AI Assistant</em> menu</p></figcaption></figure>

Help your AI Assistant learn and evolve from its knowledge base through **training**. Similar to how muscles are trained and "practiced" to get used to new activities, a Chatbot new interactions to "practice" its responses and learn from new knowledge.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Talk to your AI Assistant - it literally uses your inputs to learn!**

Our AI Assistants are capable of performing what's called **NLP** or natural language processing. This process combines their internal programming (machine learning) and linguistics to help them "learn" from interactions.&#x20;

Providing new questions and answers, as well as feedback, to your Chatbot slowly "shapes" its thought processes - allowing it to perform exactly how you need it to.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Train Your AI Assistant

Under **Train your AI Assistant**, you can do the following:

* **Enter your test question:** Write a test question that will gauge the Chatbot's response based on the current information in its knowledge base.
  * Once done, click _**Submit.**_
* **Current Answer:** This will contain a response based on the Chatbot's current database.
* **Correct Answer:** You should insert the correct answer to your question, if the response given is wrong or has to be modified.
  * Once done, click _**Add to Q\&A**_.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The list of trained Questions, Answers, and Messages will be listed here</p></figcaption></figure>

The **Trained Questions and Anwers** contain the list of Questions, Correct Answers, and Messages that have been inserted by the user.&#x20;

* **+Add with CSV:** Insert your own list of questions and answers as a CSV file instead of manually typing them.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Submit more specific Q&#x26;A files using this menu </p></figcaption></figure>

After clicking _**+Add with CSV**_, a pop-up window should appear.

In **Submit additional Q\&A:**&#x20;

* Drag the appropriate CSV (up to 100MB) containing the list of training questions and answers.
* Click _**+Add Q\&A**_
