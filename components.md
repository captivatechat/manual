The **Flow** is the cornerstone of our service. It is an interface that seamlessly connects a Chatbot, a Channel, and a Live Chat.&#x20;

When you create a Flow with Captivate, it manages all necessary integrations‚Äîensuring that all human-machine conversations across its connections are compatible and interchangeable.

An **AI Assistant** is a computer program designed to simulate human conversations through text or voice interactions. Utilizing predefined scripts and natural language processing (NLP), AI Assistants or Chatbots can understand and respond to user inputs.

Within the Captivate Flow, you can integrate your existing Chatbots or create new ones. Our platform supports the following Chatbot infrastructures:

* **IBM Watson Assistant**: Developed by IBM, this advanced Chatbot infrastructure is renowned for its flexibility and compatibility across various services and industries.

A **Channel** refers to the specific platform or medium where our Chatbots and Live Chats are deployed. They serve as a point of engagement for clients who want to communicate with your business using their preferred environment.&#x20;

* **Web Widget**
* **Messaging Services**
  * WhatsApp
* **Social Media**
  * Messenger (Facebook/Meta)
  * Instagram (Meta)
* **Custom Channel:** We can create a personalized Channel for your Captivate Flow, especially if you have a preferred deployment area outside web widgets and messaging services.

**Live Chats** enable real-time communication between agents and clients, facilitated by AI Assistants. These systems ensure seamless interaction, with Chatbots handling routine inquiries and escalating complex issues to human agents.
