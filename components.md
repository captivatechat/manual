An **AI Chatbot** is a computer program designed to simulate human conversations through text or voice interactions. Utilizing predefined scripts and natural language processing (NLP), AI Chatbots can understand and respond to user inputs.

Within Captivate Chat, you can integrate your existing AI Chatbots or create new ones. Our platform supports the following AI Chatbot infrastructures:

* **IBM Watson Assistant**: Developed by IBM, this advanced Chatbot infrastructure is renowned for its flexibility and compatibility across various services and industries.
* **AWS Lex**: Created by Amazon Web Services (AWS), AWS Lex is ideal for users within the Amazon ecosystem or the e-commerce sector.
