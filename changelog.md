## üìÜ v2.2.0-2 - 2022-02-02

It's now much easier to use the Captivate Hub for your **Livechat** needs!&#x20;

We're introducing new ways to modify your Livechat to automate certain tasks. Thanks to **Manual Assignment**, you can now set pre-determined messages that trigger after specific conditions - such as assigning chats based on an agent's MS Teams status.&#x20;

Agents can also use the new _**`"Reassign"`**_ command to transfer the chat to another available agent.&#x20;

* Implementation of **Agent Status**
  * Added `agentStatus (Array) [Available,Busy,Away,Offline]` to Hub properties.

### üÜï Agent Status (Livechat)

You can now **modify agent assignments** based on their **presence status** in MS Teams.&#x20;

Using the Livechat configuration, you can **set chat assignments** based on an agent's **status** or availability in MS Teams. Commands can affect agents who set themselves as `"Available",` `"Busy",` `"Away"` and `"Offline."`&#x20;

This example video demonstrates a Livechat configured to only assign chats to someone set as `"Busy".` Check it out:&#x20;

### üÜï Manual Assignment (Livechats)

You can now **activate **_**Manual Assignments**_ when configuring a Livechat.&#x20;

This allows **pre-made messages** to be sent after **meeting certain conditions**. Here are the properties you can modify:

*   `manualMessageUsersExist(string)`&#x20;

    Displays a message **if there is an available agent** to respond to the client.
*   `manualMessageUsersNotExist (string)`&#x20;

    Displays a message **if there are no agents available** to respond to the client.&#x20;
*   `idleTimeoutBeforeAssign(int) (in minute)`&#x20;

    A value **(in minutes)** before a timeout is declared, **should a conversation not be escalated** to an agent.&#x20;
*   `idleTimeoutAfterAssign(int) (in minute)`&#x20;

    A value **(in minutes)** before a timeout is declared, **if there's an agent assigned but neither agent nor client is responding** to each other.
*   `idleMessageBeforeTimeout (string)`&#x20;

    Displays a message when `idleTimeoutBeforeAssign(int)` elapses.
*   `idleMessageAfterTimeout (string)`&#x20;

    Display a message when \`\`idleTimeoutAfterAssign(int)\` elapses.&#x20;

#### ‚û¶ Default Values

Here are the **default Manual Assignment** values:&#x20;

* `manualAssign (bool):` false
* `manualMessageUsersExist(string):` ‚ÄúOur agents know you‚Äôre waiting and will chat here as soon as they‚Äôre free.‚Äù
* `manualMessageUsersNotExist (string):` ‚ÄúOur agents is currently busy at the moment.‚Äù
* `idleTimeoutBeforeAssign(int) (in minute):` 5
* `idleTimeoutAfterAssign(int) (in minute):` 10
* `idleMessageBeforeTimeout (string):` ‚ÄúOur agents is currently busy at the moment.‚Äù
* `idleMessageAfterTimeout (string):` ‚ÄúLivechat Ended‚Äù

#### ‚û¶ Example Scenarios

You might find this manual assignment feature useful if you encounter the following scenarios:&#x20;

*   **There are available users.**\
    Displays: **manualMessageUsersExist(string)**

    \
    Suppose Teams Group A is connected to the Captivate Hub web widget, and the channel is asking if there are any agents available. Agent A (Busy) and Agent B (Available) are currently online.\
    \
    If Manual Assignment exists that assigns a chat to anyone set as "Available" (Agent B), then the channel has to declare that there's at least one agent (Agent B) that might be available to assist them. \

* **There are no available users.**\
  Displays: **manualMessageUsersNotExist(string)** \
  \
  Suppose Teams Group A has an active channel asking if there are agents available. However, both Agent A (Busy) and Agent B (Busy) are both occupied. \
  \
  If only "Available" agents are programmed to receive chat assignments, then the channel declares there are no available agents to assist them. \

* **Time has elapsed and no users managed to assist them.**\
  Runs: **idleTimeoutBeforeAssign**\
  Displays: **idleMessageBeforeTimeout**\
  \
  Suppose Teams Group A has an active channel asking for agents, and Agent B (Available) is not busy. This will have the channel declare that an agent will assist the client soon. Until such a time that Agent B responds to the client, the chatbot will run the Idle Timeout counter. \
  \
  If the assigned time elapses and Agent B hasn't responded, a message explains that chat will be put on time out due to the lack of agent response. \

* **Time has elapsed that the agent and client didn't speak to each other.**\
  Runs: **idleTimeoutAfterAssign**\
  Displays: **idleMessageAfterTimeout**\
  \
  Suppose Teams Group A has an active channel asking for agents, and Agent B (Available) managed to respond to the client's questions. After some time, someone in the conversation hasn't responded. This triggers a background Idle Timeout counter.\
  \
  If the assigned time elapses, a message appears that states one of the parties have yet to respond and the chat will be put on time out.&#x20;

### üÜï Reassign Agent

You can now use the _**`"Reassign"`**_ command to **reassign agents within the same Teams group.**&#x20;

Normally, a Support Chatbot is assigned to an available Live Support Agent so they can answer client queries on their behalf. However, not all Live Support Agents can answer a client's questions. This is where _**Reassign**_ comes in.&#x20;

Should the need arise to transfer control of the Support Chatbot to another Live Support Agent, do this **in the MS Teams chat:**

1. Type _**`"@TheCaptivateHub"`**_ to tag the Captivate Hub
2. Type _**`"Reassign"`**_ and press _Enter_.
3. An automated message will appear alongside a drop down of available team members.
4. Select the desired team member to transfer the Support Chatbot.
