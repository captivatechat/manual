# Custom Channel

Custom channels are literally custom channels that you can connect to the hubs. These can be channels that are not yet supported by Captivate Hub or your own channels.&#x20;

Two ways to integrate your custom channels would be using Webhooks and Websockets.&#x20;

For Webhooks, the requirement is to provide an endpoint where Captivate Hub will push messages. And for Websockets, the integration is detailed in the sections.&#x20;
