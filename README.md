# ðŸ“š Overview

### What is Captivate Chat

Combine any live chat platform, any channel, any chatbot to expand collaboration inside the organization to those outside. Remove the distance between your brand and your customerâ€™s reducing their frustration and churn and / or increasing sales.

### Why a Hub?

A single telephone isnâ€™t much use but two phones provide a function.  However if you start connecting multiple phones and devices into a single network or hub you get a network effect â€“ from one phone you can reach multiple people.  Similarly, if you connect all the components of a chat ecosystem into a hub, you future proof your world and as you add a new component, say a channel, it immediately becomes useful to all other components.  Furthermore, if all data goes through one central point, you end up owning your own data with all the mining and AI potential that brings.

### Why Teams?

The Hub supports any live chat solution but with the incredible explosion of MS Teams, we figured it wise to implement it as a live chat solution. This means that The Hub allows organizations from the smallest to the largest to easily expand their use of Microsoft Teams outside of their companies bringing live chat across all channels into Microsoft Teams, not just a tab on the Microsoft Teams app, but right there inside Microsoft Teams. This means that anyone you choose can talk to the outside world â€“ contact center agents, subject matter experts or even C- Level execs without spending anything on a live chat platform.

Features:

* Expand Microsoft Teams to the outside world
* Supports all major channels
* Numerous and expanding extra features such as Natural Language routing and a selection of main vendor services
